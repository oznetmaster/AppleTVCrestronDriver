# ManifestUtil.exe builds the .pkg (a zip archive) using backslashes as the directory separator for
# entries copied from the IncludeInPkg tree (e.g. "IncludeInPkg\UiDefinitions\UiDefinition.xml"). The
# zip file format spec requires forward slashes for entry names, and Crestron Home logs a warning
# ("appears to use backslashes as path separators") when it imports such a package. This script
# rewrites every entry name in the produced .pkg in-place, replacing backslashes with forward slashes.
